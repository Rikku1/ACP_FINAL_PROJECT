## 🔍 Overview
The **ATM System** is a Python-based application that replicates the essential functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. Users can securely create accounts, log in, and perform banking operations like checking balances, depositing funds, and making withdrawals. The system supports both Checking and Savings accounts, with unique features such as transaction fees for Checking accounts and automatic interest application for Savings accounts.

The project demonstrates a practical application of Python programming principles and highlights its relevance to digital financial services.

## 🧰 Python Concepts
1. **Abstract Classes and Methods**:
   - The `UserAccount` class serves as an abstract base class, defining a blueprint for Checking and Savings accounts.
2. **Encapsulation**:
   - Sensitive attributes like balance and transaction fees are private, with controlled access through property methods.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - `try`-`except` blocks ensure robust error management for invalid inputs and transactions.
4. **Datetime Module**:
   - Used in `SavingsAccount` to calculate and apply interest based on the elapsed time.
5. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensures proper formatting for account numbers, PINs, and monetary values.
